# Myopia_Clusters

In this assignment, I applied what i learned about unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, I created a visualization that shares my findings.

In part 1 I prepared the data
* I Read myopia.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.

* I Removed the "MYOPIC" column from the dataset.
